A mashup of several Java "utility method" projects I've had over the years.

Some of this is in use, some not.  The active bit is under `src/com/github/jonross/stuff4j`.
The general goal with Stuff4J is to replace some of the annoying imperative boilerplate in
Java with more functional idioms.

There are no runtime dependencies apart from Java 9.
