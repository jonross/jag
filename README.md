Stuff4J is whatever code I currently find most useful for building Java apps, that is not already
available without fuss in Commons Lang, Guava, JOOL, et cetera.

Most of it is geared toward reducing the awful boilerplate that erupts when combining lambdas with
checked exceptions.

Feel free to use.  MIT-licensed, no runtime dependencies apart from Java 9.
