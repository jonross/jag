These are useful methods and tiny utility classes that I often reach for when coding prototypes.

They really should be factored into more classes and smartly documented for the enterprise, like
Guava and Apache Commons.  But I have no pretensions that more than a couple people will ever see
this, so in keeping with YAGNI, everything is piled into one class that you can paste into a
project, rather like pasting a JS library script tag into a web page.

There are no dependencies apart from Java 8.

Some other nice tools for cranking out demos quickly:

* https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOL
* https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/fugue
* https://vuejs.org/ (if you're a server side guy and don't want to be buried in crap when you need a quick UI, this is your framework)
